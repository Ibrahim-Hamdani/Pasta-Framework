PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a risk-centric threat modeling framework used in cybersecurity to identify, analyze, and mitigate threats to applications and systems. It provides a structured approach to understanding how attackers might exploit vulnerabilities and how organizations can proactively defend against them.

Key Features of PASTA:
Risk-Based Approach – Focuses on business impact and aligns security efforts with organizational risks.
Attack Simulation – Simulates real-world attacks to understand how an adversary might exploit vulnerabilities.
Threat Intelligence Integration – Incorporates real-time threat intelligence to make analysis more relevant.
Alignment with Security Controls – Helps organizations implement effective security controls based on identified risks.


The 7 Stages of PASTA
PASTA consists of seven distinct stages that guide security professionals in identifying and mitigating threats:

Define Objectives

Understand business objectives and security requirements.
Identify assets and critical functionalities.
Define the Technical Scope

Identify technologies, infrastructure, and dependencies.
Define the attack surface.
Application Decomposition

Break down the application into components and data flows.
Understand how data moves within the system.
Threat Analysis

Identify potential threats using threat intelligence sources.
Use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to map threats.
Vulnerability & Weakness Analysis

Assess existing security vulnerabilities.
Use tools like vulnerability scanners and penetration testing.
Attack Simulation & Modeling

Simulate how attackers would exploit identified weaknesses.
Evaluate attack feasibility and impact.
Risk & Impact Analysis

Determine the business impact of successful attacks.
Prioritize remediation efforts based on risk levels.
Why Use PASTA?
Comprehensive: Covers threat modeling from a business and technical perspective.
Proactive: Helps organizations anticipate threats rather than react to them.
Scalable: Can be applied to different environments, from applications to enterprise security.
PASTA is commonly used by security teams in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government, where risk-based security is a priority.
